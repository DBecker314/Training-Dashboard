# Training Dashboard

### Overview
The customer desired a trend analysis of test results. However, the proprietary nature of the test categories and sub-categories required that the customer first rename, or “cloak,” the data. The goal of this project was to display trends in the data and show which categories had the lowest results.

### Data

The data for this project is taken during company training weeks, where employees are scored from zero to five based on their ability to perform the tasks required of them.  Some categories are scored three times per week, while others are scored only once.  This data is collected on separate spreadsheets using a standard format.

### Deliverables

Due to the nature of the data, there are a few things that must be satisfied in the final product.
- Expandable (New data must be easy to add)
- Accurate (Results must take into account scoring differences between categories)
- Filterable (Final product must be able to show individual sub-categories of data)

### Results

The final product for this project is an excel dashboard.  It can be updated simply by copying and pasting new data from the formatted scoring sheets into the data section.  The average score for each category is tracked weekly to measure improvement, and the overall average scores are displayed in a bar plot to compare performance.  Both of these charts are filterable.

### Conclusion

This dashboard will help the company determine weak points in the training curriculum allowing for better training programs and better results.  This dashboard also tracks employee progress week-by-week to make sure curriculum changes have the intended effect.
